To perform speech-to-text conversion in Python, we can use
the SpeechRecognition library. It provides an interface to several
popular speech recognition engines, including Google Speech
Recognition, Sphinx, and Microsoft Azure Speech.

Install the SpeechRecognition library using pip: pip install SpeechRecognition

Windows users can install pyaudio by executing the following command in a terminal

Install the Pyaudio library using pip: pip install pyaudio

Using Tkinter's for GUI interface

To process images with Tkinter and other Python packages, we generally
use the Pillow Package (or PIL) in Python.

Install the Pillow library using pip: pip install Pillow

we have a single button labeled "Start Listening". When this button is pressed,
the start_listening() function is called. Inside this function,
the listening message ("Listening...") is displayed in the side_text widget, and
a new thread is created to perform the speech-to-text conversion
using the convert_speech() function.
