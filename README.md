## Project Highlights

This repository encompasses a variety of Python projects and code, covering different domains and purposes, including but not limited to:
##
### Screen Recorder:
    This Python script captures the "screen" and `records` it as a video in AVI format. It uses the PyAutoGUI library 
    to capture screenshots, OpenCV (cv2) for video processing, and NumPy for array handling. The script allows you 
    to specify the resolution, video codec, frames per second (fps), and output file name. It creates a resizable 
    window to display the live recording, and you can stop the recording by pressing the 'q' key. 
    This code is a simple tool for screen recording and can be a building block for more complex applications or projects 
    involving screen capture and video creation.
##
### Speech to Text:
    This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface for converting 
    speech to text. It uses the SpeechRecognition library for capturing audio input from the microphone. 
    The script allows users to click on a microphone button, triggering a speech-to-text conversion. The converted text 
    is displayed in a text entry field, making it a handy tool for quickly transcribing spoken words. 
    Additionally, it employs the pyttsx3 library to read out the recognized text.
##
### Text to Speech:
    Record your screen and save recordings in video format.
##
### Translate one Language to another:
    Record your screen and save recordings in video format.
