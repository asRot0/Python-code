## Project Highlights

This repository encompasses a variety of Python projects and code, covering different domains and purposes, including but not limited to:
##
### IP Address info
    This is a Python code snippet for an IP tracker. It uses the requests library to get the IP address
    of the user and the ipapi.co API to get the IP information. The code then prints the IP information
    to the console in a yellow color. The user can also choose to track another IP address by entering the
    IP address in the console.
##
### Screen Recorder:
    This Python script captures the screen and records it as a video in AVI format. It uses the PyAutoGUI 
    library to capture screenshots, OpenCV (cv2) for video processing, and NumPy for array handling. 
    The script allows you to specify the resolution, video codec, frames per second (fps), and output file 
    name. It creates a resizable window to display the live recording, and you can stop the recording by 
    pressing the 'q' key. This code is a simple tool for screen recording and can be a building block for 
    more complex applications or projects involving screen capture and video creation.
##
### Speech to Text:
    This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface for 
    converting speech to text. It uses the SpeechRecognition library for capturing audio input from the 
    microphone. The script allows users to click on a microphone button, triggering a speech-to-text 
    conversion. The converted text is displayed in a text entry field, making it a handy tool for quickly 
    transcribing spoken words. It employs the pyttsx3 library to read out the recognized text.
##
### Text to Speech:
    This Python script demonstrates a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application using the Tkinter and 
    pyttsx3 libraries. It creates a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input text into a text 
    entry field. Upon clicking the "Convert to Speech" button, the entered text is converted to speech 
    using the pyttsx3 engine. Users can listen to the generated speech output, making it a convenient tool 
    for converting text content into an audible format. The script allows customization of speech 
    properties, such as speech rate, volume, and voice selection.
##
### Translate one Language to another:
    This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for text translation using the Google 
    Translate service. Users can select the source and destination languages from dropdown menus, enter 
    text to be translated, and then click the "Translate" button. The entered text is translated using 
    the Google Translate API, and the translated text is displayed in the destination text area. This 
    application serves as a simple tool for translating text between different languages with user-friendly
    interface.

    The code employs the tkinter library for building the GUI and uses the googletrans library for 
    language translation, offering a straightforward translation solution for users.
